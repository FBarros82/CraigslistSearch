# Craiglist Quick Search

I've got a lot of Craigslist searches, and I can save time by having this Python script get me the latest results.

### Installation

Requires Python >= 3.7.0

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### Run the script

    python craigslist.py
    
That will create an HTML file `results.html` allowing you to click the individual search results.
